## Assignment 4 
In Assignment 4, we implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch. The task is to recognize bangla handwritten digits from the [Numta Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/BengaliAI/numta)

### Description
 - We use `ReLU` for activation layer and `Max` pooling
 - We incorporate several image preprocessing techniques
   - Compress image pixels
   - Convert the image from BGR to RGB format
   - Incorporate Dilation
